# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #5
[Initial version](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/edit/master/lab%235/README.md)

## Title
Collaboration. Complex application: Traffic light

## Contents
* Collaboration
* All previously studied things

## Mandatory Objectives
* Create an application which has:
  * Child windows controls
  * GDI animation
* Animation should be controlled by controls


### Laboratory work Requirements:
* Work on this project in a team of 2-3 persons 
* Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it)
* First create a sketch, then work on code  _(commit sketches early)_

* Simulate the work of a traffic light

  - for _Basic Level_ (grade 5 || 6) you should be able to:
    * Simulate the work of a traffic light for an intersection with 4 traffic lights.
    ![example](http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/images/roads/safety-rules/roadrules/traffic-lights-car-a.jpg "Graphical example")
    * The user should be able to increase the speed of traffic light (interval when colors are changed)
    * The user may be able to increase the number of generated random cars 
  - for _Normal Level_ (grade 7 || 8) you should be able to:
    * Realize the tasks from _Basic Level_.
    * In the simulation should be present 2 crosswalks with people passing.
    * Random special cars crossing (at least2; ex. ambulance, president care, police car, etc)
  - for _Advanced Level_ (grade 9 || 10) you should be able to:
    * Introducing of the car accident generated by the wrong crossing of the car/pedestrian or presence of drunk driver
  - for _Bonus Point Tasks_ :
    * 1 point per each new added creative idea. 

In provided examples it is easy to divide tasks for 2: one may work on animation and the second one or two can work on controls.

If you'll work in a team:
* I recommend to create new repository outside TUM-FAF organisation, or you may ask me for a new private repository
* It is not desired to work on this lab work using your actual (provided by me) repositories as them are intended for personal use
* Each member will work on a separate branch, and someone will take care to review the code and merge with master.
* Points that you'll gain will be assigned to each of members that participated in application development

## References
* search for any collaboration tutorial, but main idea is to have one common repository, divide tasks and work on them alone but for common purpose
