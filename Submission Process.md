# Submission Process

**All reports should be in english and in .PDF format**

First of all you need access to a private/public organization repository. [How to do it?](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/wiki/GitHub-Workflow)

When your repository is set up, I suggest doing following steps:

1. Clone repository on your working machine (if it is new uninitialized repository than you'll have to initialize it)
* Add .gitignore and README files [details here](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/blob/master/lab%231/lab%231.md#using-vcs-git-or-svn-and-github)
* Create a WP folder
* Create laboratory work #1 folder (Lab#1)
* Work on your lab, commit often (when necessary)
* When your work is done, write a readme that explains what you've done, any problems you encountered, any things you are proud of (and other related stuff). If you project requires some specific steps to be done in order to compile/run your project, add this details in README. [how to do this](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* Merge branch with master (if you worked not on master)
* Push changes to GitHub
* Create a laboratory work report that will contain ([example](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP2/tree/master/TEX%20template)):
  * Title page
  * Laboratory work purpose and requirements
  * A list of implemented tasks
  * Explanation of how you've done/implemented laboratory tasks (make references to code snippets from Appendices)
  * Screens of every feature you had implemented
  * Conclusion (0.3 to 1 page)
  * Bibliography (if any)
  * Title of the .pdf file should follow this pattern: _(WP FAF 121 Surname Name Lab#0.pdf)_
* Check you submission against [frequently used suggestions](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP2/blob/master/Suggestions.md)
* Submit your report and a link to your GitHub repository to my email
